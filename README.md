## Get started

### Rules

1. Be a nice person. Don't be a jerk or someone that brings negativity. Don't make comments with the purpose to instigate something/someone, intentionally or not. Don't make jokes that will be generally disliked. 

2. Keep in mind SST's Code of Conduct, 10Cs and 4Rs.

3. Not knowing the rules is no excuse.

### I have an issue and need help!

0. Search through the discussions to see if someone else already posted a similar issue

1. Create a new discussion (refer to the quick link above)

2. Select the relevant discussion category

3. Write a brief title, for example:

```
Error while installing Homebrew
```

4. Provide a detailed description of your issue, for example:

```
Lesson **lesson number**

I tried this code:

<code>

I expected to see this happen: **explanation**

Instead, this happened: **explanation**
```

> Note: Include any files or images that helps describe your issue

5. Post your issue

6. Once someone has resolved your issue, remember to mark the reply as the answer, so others that have the same issue know which solution works

### Why isn't anyone replying to my issue?

#### Don't expect immediate responses

It will take time for your trainers to respond to questions, don't expect instant responses after submitting your questions. Your trainers try their best to help you, give them a bit of time

If your issue is urgent or has not been answered after an hour, you can label it as `urgent`

#### Check if it's a duplicate

If a similar question already exists, but isn't resolved yet, upvote or reply to it. This helps to prioritise which questions most people have and answer questions quickly

Avoid asking duplicate questions as much as possible

#### Provide Descriptive Questions

In order to make it easier your trainer to understand the question, try to provide them with the necessary. Here are some pointers you can keep in mind:

- What have you done it resolve it?

- Any screenshots/screen recordings?

- What change did you make that caused the problem? Maybe you clicked a button? Maybe you deleted a file?

- Which lesson is this question from? Or is it while you're experimenting and trying your own things out?

- Ensure that it's categorized properly, iOS questions should be categorised as iOS, Android questions should be categorized as Android. 

#### Send the correct files (iOS only)

1. When attaching from Xcode, go to the parent folder (the folder with the same name as your project name that contains your `.xcodeproj` file and another folder)

2. `control-click` (or right click) on the parent folder then select `Compress`

3. A `.zip` file will be created. Attach the `.zip` file to your discussion post

> Note: It can be a difficult to debug an entire project, if possible, try to isolate the possible files that might be relevant to the question and submit those. This will make it faster for those debugging

#### Are you using third-party libraries?

Please include any links to third-party packages, libraries or extensions you may be using in your project

Instead of writing this in your description:

```
I am using VeryGreatApi to create an animation 
```

Include the links to VeryGreatApi so your trainers can look into it and have a better idea on how to assist you

```
I am using [VeryGreatApi](https://issteven.xyz) to create an animation 
```
