## Get started

### Rules

1. Be a nice person. Don't be a jerk or someone that brings negativity. Don't make comments with the purpose to instigate something/someone, intentionally or not. Don't make jokes that will be generally disliked. 

2. Keep in mind SST's Code of Conduct, 10Cs and 4Rs.

3. Not knowing the rules is no excuse.

### I have an issue and need help!

0. Search through the discussions to see if someone else already posted a similar issue

1. Create a new discussion (refer to the quick link above)

2. Select the relevant discussion category

3. Write a brief title, for example:

```
Error while installing Homebrew
```

4. Provide a detailed description of your issue, for example:

```
Lesson **lesson number**

I tried this code:

<code>

I expected to see this happen: **explanation**

Instead, this happened: **explanation**
```

Include any files or images that helps describe your issue

5. Post your issue

6. Once someone has resolved your issue, remember to mark the reply as the answer, so others that have the same issue know which solution works

### Why isn't anyone replying to my issue?
#### Don't expect immediate responses
It will take time for those debugging to respond to questions, don't expect instant responses after submitting your question.

#### Check if it's a duplicate
If a similar question already exists, but isn't resolved yet, upvote or reply to it. This can help to prioritise which questions most people have and answer questions quickly.

#### Provide Descriptive Questions
In order to make it easier for the person on the other end to understand the question, try to provide them with the necessary information such as...
- What have you done it resolve it?
- Any screenshots/screen recordings?
- What change did you make that caused the problem? Maybe you clicked a button? Maybe you deleted a file?
- Which lesson is this question from? Or is it while you're experimenting and trying your own things out?
- Ensure that it's categorised properly, iOS questions should be categorised as iOS, Android questions should be categorised as Android.

#### Send the correct files
This is especially relevant for iOS/Xcode
1. When attaching from Xcode, go to the parent folder (the folder with the same name as your project name that contains your `.xcodeproj` file and another folder)
2. `control-click` (or right click) on the parent folder then select `Compress`
3. A `.zip` file will be created. Attach the `.zip` file to your discussion post.
> Note: It can be a difficult to debug an entire project, if possible, try to isolate the possible files that might be relevant to the question and submit those. This will make it faster for those debugging.

#### Using Third-Party Libraries?
Please include any links to third-party packages, libraries or extensions you may be using in your question. 

Saying things like this can be very hard for those trying to resolve the question to understand it.
```
I am using VeryGreatApi to create an animation 
```
Instead, use something like this, where those working to resolve the question can look into it and understand what packages you may be using
```
I am using [VeryGreatApi](https://issteven.xyz) to create an animation 
```
